A Jumpboard Cardio Reformer is a Pilates-based workout that incorporates a padded, vertical jumpboard attachment on the Reformer machine. This turns traditional horizontal Pilates movements into a plyometric cardio session, simulating the effect of jumping without the joint stress typically associated with high-impact activities.
